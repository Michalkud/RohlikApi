# Cursor Rule Generation Standard

## Critical Rules
- All rules must be placed in `.cursor/rules/` or its subfolders, never elsewhere.
- Use `.mdc` files with YAML frontmatter: description, globs, alwaysApply.
- Organize rules by domain: `core-rules`, `ts-rules`, `tool-rules`, `testing-rules`, `ui-rules`, etc.
- Rule file names must end with `-always.mdc`, `-auto.mdc`, `-agent.mdc`, or `-manual.mdc` according to type.
- Always include valid and invalid examples in each rule.
- Use concise, actionable language and avoid unnecessary explanation.
- When updating or creating a rule, check for existing rules to update first.
- Never use quotes around glob patterns; use comma-separated values only.
- Prune or update rules as the codebase evolves.

## Examples
<example>
  A new TypeScript style rule is requested. The agent creates `.cursor/rules/ts-rules/ts-style-agent.mdc` with proper frontmatter, actionable rules, and examples.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
  A rule is created in the project root or without frontmatter, or with missing examples.
</example>
