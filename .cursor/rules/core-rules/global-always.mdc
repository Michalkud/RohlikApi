# Global Project Standards

## Critical Rules
- Always use TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
- Use pnpm for all package management and workspace operations.
- Node.js 20+ (ESM) is the only supported runtime.
- Store secrets in `.env.local` for dev, AWS Secrets Manager for prod.
- All code must be formatted and linted before commit.
- Use OpenAPI as the single source of truth for API contracts.
- Document all public APIs and exported functions.
- Use MCP endpoints for all agent/server communication.
- Place all new packages in `packages/`, services in `services/`, and UI in `ui/`.

## Examples
<example>
  A new service is added under `services/` and uses Fastify, TypeScript, and MCP endpoints, following the OpenAPI contract.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
  A new package is created outside `packages/`, or a service is written in JavaScript or without strict typing.
</example>
